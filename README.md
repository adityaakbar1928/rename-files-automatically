# rename-files-automatically
do you want to rename your files? but it is to hard because your files that need to be renamed are in subfolders? well, use my code here, it will change your files extension to whatever you want, even your files in subfolders

You can use the .exe version if you dont install python in your computer, or you can just download the .py version and feel free to edit the code
